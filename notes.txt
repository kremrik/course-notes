Lecture 1A: Overview and Introduction to Lisp

Computer science is about managin complexity of complex systems. We manage complexity through prodedure, a pattern of rules, implemented in programming languages to talk about imperative knowledge, how to do things. Three techniques of managing complexity are blackbox abstraction, conventional inference, and metalinguistic abstraction. The last one is creation of programming language to expose or hide complexity. A framework for understanding programming languages are to ask three questions. What are the primitives? How do we combine primitives? How do we add abstraction?
